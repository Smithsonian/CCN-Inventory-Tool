## Hello User
### Purpose of this interface

Welcome to the Coastal Carbon Inventorying tool, developed by the Coastal Carbon Network, housed at the Smithsonian Institution. This interface serves as a digital dashboard for all blue carbon stakeholders that will provide global blue carbon data in formats that decision makers can easily and freely access and use. It contains direct access to existing and future blue carbon data from the Coastal Carbon Atlas, while providing high-quality estimates of country-level carbon stocks.

### Dashboard Use

Navigate to the dashboard home page and select your country of interest from the dropdown menu. Then explore the panels containing country-specific visualizations, tables, and insights.
