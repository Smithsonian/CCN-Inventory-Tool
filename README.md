# Blue Carbon Inventory Tool

This interface serves as a digital dashboard for all blue carbon stakeholders that will provide relevant information in formats that decision makers can easily and freely access and use. It leverages open data from the [Coastal Carbon Atlas](https://shiny.si.edu/coastal_carbon_atlas/) to provide high-quality estimates of country-level carbon stocks and compares these to values determined using other methods accepted by the IPCC.

_Created and maintained by the [Coastal Carbon Network](https://serc.si.edu/coastalcarbon) at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center._

The development of this dashboard was made possible by NOAA and the HASI Foundation.
